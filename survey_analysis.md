## Conclusion

RightPlace has strong product-market fit with power users who manage multiple WordPress sites. The core value proposition is clear and working well for daily users. However, there are significant barriers preventing trial users from becoming power users, primarily around performance, missing features, and onboarding.

The good news is that the barriers are mostly addressable through product improvements rather than fundamental product-market fit issues. Focusing on stability, onboarding, and the most-requested features should significantly improve conversion from trial to power users.
