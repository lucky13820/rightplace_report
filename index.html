                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                
                <h4>Short-term (1-2 months)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fix performance issues</strong> - This is blocking 40% of trial users</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve onboarding</strong> - Add tutorials and better documentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhance auto-login</strong> - Work with security plugins like Fortress Security</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Medium-term (3-6 months)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Launch AI features</strong> - High demand from both segments</li>
                    <li><strong>Add multi-window support</strong> - Frequently requested feature</li>
                    <li><strong>Develop SSH/SFTP terminal</strong> - Would replace external tools</li>
                    <li><strong>Create MainWP integration</strong> - Bridge to existing workflows</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Long-term (6+ months)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Database migration tools</strong> - Would be a major differentiator</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced blueprint features</strong> - Build on existing asset management</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile/tablet support</strong> - Some users mentioned iPad usage</li>
                </ol>
